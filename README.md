## Features

* Choose among four different algorithms, which will change how power lines are connected between the pole network
* To see power lines easier among a dense tangle of them, each power line connects with a slight "sag" and curve -- just like power lines in the real world!
* Place up to 324 power poles
* Each pole has a central "connector" object in dark blue that further helps clarify and reduce visual clutter
* Unconnected power pole nodes show up as red squares to indicate they aren't powered yet
* Clear the grid at any time to start fresh
